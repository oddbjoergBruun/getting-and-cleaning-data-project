# Getting and cleaning data project



This is the final project for week 4 of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The original data set can be downloaded from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip





The R.script `run_analysis.R` aimes to clean the original data sets and create a new tidy data set, `avg_dat.txt`, by doing the following:

1) Load and merge the training and the test sets.

2) Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3) Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.

4) Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names, and merge all data sets to one data set.

5) From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
